title: About
text: I’m a UI/UX designer based in Salt Lake City, Utah currently working for bridal designer Maggie Sottero. For 8 years I’ve been honing a human-centered design style that places the user at the center of a unique, hand-crafted experience.
textHighlight: When I’m not designing, I can be found doing the dad thing, snowmobiling in God’s country, catching up on NBA news, or working on a novel (its really good, my mom said so).
